    <h2>Caramel Apple Pie Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        These caramel apple pie cookies taste like mini apple pies. Try them warmed up with ice cream and you'll be reminded of Thanksgiving.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (14.1-ounce) package rolled refrigerated unbaked pie crusts (2 crusts)</li>
        <li>1 cup purchased apple pie filling</li>
        <li>1/4 cup caramel sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon apple pie or ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon half and half</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Let pie crusts stand according to package directions. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer apple pie filling into a food processor.  Lightly pulse apple pie filling in a food processor until in 1/4-inch chunks (see Cook's Note).
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll one pie crust into a 14-inch circle on a lightly floured piece of parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using a pizza cutter or a sharp knife, cut 1/4-inch wide strips.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover cut pie dough with parchment paper or plastic wrap and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll remaining pie crust dough into a 13-inch circle on lightly floured piece of parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread caramel sauce over rolled pastry.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spoon apple pie filling over caramel sauce, spreading so that it is evenly distributed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a lattice top with dough strips by alternately placing strips on top of the filling.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using a 2 1/2-inch diameter cookie cutter, cut rounds from pastry.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer cookies to the prepared baking sheets.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir together sugar and apple pie spice in a small bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Brush cookies with half and half and sprinkle cookies with sugar and spice mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are golden brown, about 12 minutes (working in batches).
        </li>
        <li>
            Cool on baking sheets on wire racks for 20 minutes. Remove cookies to a serving tray and serve warm.
