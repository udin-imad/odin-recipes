    <h2>No-churn Blackberry Ice Cream</h2>
    <p>
        This no-churn blackberry ice cream is without a doubt one of my all-time favorite ways to enjoy fresh blackberries in season. The texture is absolutely perfect - you’ll have no idea you didn’t use a machine, and the fresh blackberries you’ll smash in at the end takes it from great to mind-blowing.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds fresh blackberries, rinsed and drained, divided</li>
        <li>1/3 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Add 1 1/2 pounds of the blackberries (about 5 cups), sugar, and lemon juice to a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a potato masher to crush berries, and continue to simmer until mixture thickens and reduces by half, about 20 minutes. Heat can be turned up to reduce faster, but will require more careful watching to be sure blackberries do not scorch.
        </li>
        <li>
            Strain blackberry mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl, being sure to get every drop of juice; discard fiber and seeds. Stir sweetened condensed milk and vanilla into the bowl; refrigerate mixture until completely cold, about 1 hour. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until medium-stiff peaks form. Add half the whipped cream to chilled blackberry mixture; fold in with a whisk until almost all the cream is incorporated. Add remaining whipped cream; use a spatula to gently fold in. Pour mixture into a container, cover, and freeze until solid, at least 4 hours and up to overnight. 
        </li>
        <li>
            To serve, add as many of the fresh berries you want to the top, and use an ice cream scoop to mix and smash them into the ice cream as you scoop. Add a few remaining berries on top of each serving.
